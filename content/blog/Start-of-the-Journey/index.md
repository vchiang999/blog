Hey there, welcome to my blog! I'm here to share with you my journey of learning Azure AZ-900, the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification. Azure is a cloud computing platform that offers a lot of services and solutions for various needs. I wanted to learn more about it and get certified, so I enrolled in the Microsoft learning online course and various other learning platform and started studying.

One of the topics that caught my attention was Azure Static Web Apps, a service that allows you to easily deploy and host static web apps with minimal configuration. Static web apps are websites that don't have any server-side code or database, just HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. They are fast, secure and scalable, and they can also integrate with serverless functions and APIs if needed.

I thought to myself, what a great way to implement and showcase the knowledge I've learned by hosting my CV online and blog using Azure Static Web Apps. So I decided to give it a try and see how it works. In my future blog posts, I will show you how I did it and what challenges I faced along the way. Let's get started!
