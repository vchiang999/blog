One of the coolest features of Azure Web App is that it can automatically deploy your code from GitHub. This means that every time you push a change to your GitHub repository, Azure Web App will update your web app with the latest version of your code. This way, you can always have a fresh and updated web app without any hassle.

GitHub is a platform that allows you to store, manage, and collaborate on your code projects. You can create repositories, branches, commits, pull requests, issues, and more. GitHub also integrates with many other tools and services, such as Azure Web App.

Azure Web App is a service that lets you create and host web applications in the cloud. You can use various languages and frameworks, such as .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, etc. You can also scale your web app up or down, configure settings, monitor performance, and more.
